[Oyakodon (Japanese Chicken and Egg Rice Bowl) Recipe \| Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/08/oyakodon-japanese-chicken-and-egg-rice-bowl-recipe.html)

### overview

- Prep **20 min**
- Cook **20 min**
- Serves **2**

### ingredients

- 1 cup (240ml) homemade dashi, or the equivalent in Hondashi (see note)
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce, plus more to taste
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) dry sake
- 1 tablespoon (15g) sugar, plus more to taste
- 1 large onion, slivered (about 6 ounces; 170g)
- 12 ounces (340g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, thinly sliced (see note)
- 3 thinly sliced scallions, divided
- 2 stems mitsuba (optional; see note)
- 3 to 4 large eggs (see note)

### prep

1. Combine **dashi**, **soy sauce**, **sake**, and **sugar** in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over high heat. Adjust heat to maintain a strong simmer. Stir in **onion** and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is half tender, about 5 minutes. Add **chicken** pieces and cook, stirring and turning chicken occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and broth has reduced by about half, 5 to 7 minutes for chicken thighs or 3 to 4 minutes for chicken breast. Stir in half of **scallions** and all of **mitsuba** (if using), then season broth to taste with more soy sauce or sugar as desired. The sauce should have a balanced sweet-and-salty flavor.
2. Reduce heat to a bare simmer. Beat **eggs** lightly with chopsticks in a medium bowl. Pour eggs into pot in a thin, steady stream (see note), holding your chopsticks over edge of bowl to help distribute eggs evenly (see video above). Cover and cook until eggs are cooked to desired doneness, about 1 minute for runny eggs or 3 minutes for medium-firm.
3. To Serve: Transfer hot **rice** to a single large bowl or 2 individual serving bowls. Top with egg and chicken mixture, pouring out any excess broth from saucepan over rice. Add an extra egg **yolk** to center of each bowl, if desired (see note). Garnish with remaining half of sliced scallions and togarashi. Serve immediately.
