- Yield: Serves 2 to 4 as a side
- ACTIVE TIME: 30 minutes
- TOTAL TIME: 30 minutes

## Why It Works
- The lemon juice not only adds flavor but also steams the potatoes from below, giving them a creamy texture.
- Slicing the potatoes thinly and leaving them in a single shingled layer ensures they cook through in a short time under the broiler.

## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 pound (450g) Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced 1/8 inch thick
- Kosher or sea salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup (60ml) fresh lemon juice, from about 1 lemon, plus zest of 1 lemon
- 8 ounces (225g) halloumi cheese, thinly sliced
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano

## Directions
1. Preheat broiler and set top oven rack about 6 inches from broiler element. Add olive oil to a 12-inch cast iron skillet and spread evenly all over.
2. Add potatoes, shingling the slices around the pan in a single circular layer. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Broil until the potatoes have puffed up slightly, mostly cooked through, and browned on top, about 7 minutes.
4. Pour lemon juice all over potatoes and sprinkle zest on top. Add halloumi cheese in an even layer on top and broil until cheese is golden brown all over and potatoes are fully cooked through, about 4 minutes.
5. Sprinkle oregano on top and serve.

## Anmerkungen:
- Broiler auf hoher Stufe
- Hat alles etwas länger gebraucht um zu bräunen, dafür waren die artoffeln sehr gut durch, obwohl sie eher in 2 statt 1 Schicht waren.
- Zitrone sehr stark, darf etwas dezenter sein
- Trotzdem lecker!
