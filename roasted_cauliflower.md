## **Ingredients**

- 1 head cauliflower, trimmed and cut into 8 wedges
- 6 tablespoons (90ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) sherry vinegar
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) honey
- 2 tablespoons capers, rinsed, drained, and roughly chopped
- 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts
- 1/4 cup raisins
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley leaves

## **Directions**

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). Toss cauliflower with 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Roast until cauliflower is tender and deeply browned on both sides, about 20 minutes total, flipping cauliflower with a thin metal spatula halfway through roasting.
2. While cauliflower roasts, combine remaining 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil, vinegar, honey, capers, pine nuts, raisins, and parsley. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.
3. Transfer cooked cauliflower to a serving plate and spoon dressing on top. Serve immediately.
