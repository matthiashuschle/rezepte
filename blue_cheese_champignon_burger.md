## Ingredients
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil

## Directions
1. Preheat your broiler. Line a small baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. In a small bowl, combine Worcestershire, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Whisk.
3. Brush both sides of mushrooms caps with mixture. Place them gill-side-up on your baking sheet. Broil 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from broiler. Sprinkle evenly with blue cheese. Broil about 2 more minutes, until cheese is browned a tiny bit melty. Remove from broiler, place on a plate, and set aside for a minute.
