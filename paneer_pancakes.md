# Paneer Pancakes

[Paneer-stuffed pancakes recipe - BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/paneer-stuffed-pancakes)

## Ingredients

- 1 large egg , lightly beaten
- 100ml semi-skimmed milk
- 50g plain flour
- 1 tsp sunflower oil , plus extra for frying the pancakes
- 100g frozen spinach
- ½ x 226g pack paneer , cut into medium cubes
- 1 tbsp hot curry paste
- 400g can chickpeas , drained and rinsed
- 150g passata
- 75ml coconut yogurt
- 1 tbsp mango chutney

## Method

1. Heat oven to 110C/90C fan/gas 1/4. To make the pancake batter, gradually mix the egg and milk into the flour either in a food processor or in a bowl by hand with a whisk. Heat a little oil in a non-stick crêpe or frying pan over a medium heat. Pour in about a quarter of the batter and swirl it around to coat the pan. Cook for about 30 secs on each side, then lift onto a baking tray and put in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the rest of the batter, adding a little more oil to the pan each time – layer baking parchment between the finished pancakes so they don’t stick together.
1. Cook the frozen spinach in the microwave for 4 mins or following pack instructions. Meanwhile, heat 1 tsp oil in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Add the paneer and fry for 20 secs on each side until crisp and golden. Stir in the curry paste, then add the chickpeas, passata and spinach, and heat through. If the mixture is too dry, add a splash of water.
1. Mix the coconut yogurt with the mango chutney. Divide the hot filling between the pancakes, spoon on some yogurt, then roll up to serve.
