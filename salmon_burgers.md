- 2 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, tarragon, and chives (about 1 teaspoon each minced parsley and chives and 1/2 teaspoon minced tarragon
- 2 teaspoons fresh juice from 1 lemon (10ml)

## Slaw

- 1 3/4 ounces peeled celery root (50g; from 1 small root), julienned
- 1 3/4 ounces shredded radicchio (50g; from 1 small head)
- 1 3/4 ounces fennel (50g; from 1 small hear), julienned
- Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
- Fresh juice from 1 lemon, for drizzling
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Cooking and Serving

- 1 cup panko bread crumbs
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil (60ml)
- 4 brioche hamburger buns, buttered and toasted

# Directions

## 1. Patties

In a medium bowl, combine salmon, herbs, coriander seed, and ginger. Stir well, then season with salt and pepper. (You can cook a very small amount in a nonstick skillet to check salt levels, and then adjust accordingly). Set in refrigerator.

## 2. Remoulade

In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, capers, cornichons, herbs, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and horseradish until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to refrigerator.

## 3. Slaw

In a medium bowl, combine celery root, radicchio, and fennel. Drizzle with just enough olive oil to coat and sprinkle with lemon juice to taste. Set aside.

## 4. Cooking and Serving

1. Spread panko bread crumbs in a shallow bowl or pie plate, and arrange a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Divide salmon mixture into 4 even portions and, working one at a time, roll each into a ball, then flatten into a 1-inch thick patty, using your hands to smooth out any cracked edges (they may squirm around on you a little, but keep at it and they'll come together).
2. Place each patty in the bowl of bread crumbs, use your hands to sprinkle more bread crumbs on top, then press down gently to make bread crumbs adhere to the bottom side. Flip patty and press gently once more, then transfer to the parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining salmon.
3. Add oil to a large cast iron skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Carefully lower salmon patties into the oil and cook, turning once or twice, until lightly browned on both sides and medium-rare within (about 115 to 120°F on an instant-read thermometer), about 10 minutes; adjust heat as necessary to keep things sizzling without scorching the bread crumbs.
4. Transfer patties to a paper towel-lined tray and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. Smear an even layer of rémoulade on the top and bottom halves of each bun. Set a salmon patty on top of each bottom bun. Season slaw with salt and pepper, then mound some on top of each patty. Close sandwiches and serve right away.
